Implement Deep Learning Techniques To Detect Malaria Using IBM Cloud


Malaria is a deadly, infectious mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. These deadly parasites can live in your body for over a year without any problems!
Thus, a delay in the right treatment can lead to complications and even death. Hence early and effective testing and detection of malaria can save lives. 
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have the ability to automatically extract features and learn filters.

Libraries Used:
TensorFlow
Flask
Render_Template
Request
ImageDatagenerator

Frameworks used:
Bootstrap 5
